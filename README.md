# Bond Tokenization Smart Contract

# Bond Struct
```solidity
struct Bond {
    uint256 principal;
    uint256 couponRate;
    uint256 maturity;
    uint256 couponFrequency;
    address issuer;
    mapping(address => bool) whitelist;
    mapping(address => bool) kycApproved;
    mapping(address => bool) highRiskCustomers;
    mapping(address => uint256) couponPayments;
}```

The Bond struct represents a bond with the following properties:

`principal`: The principal amount of the bond.

`couponRate`: The coupon rate of the bond.

`maturity`: The maturity date of the bond.

`couponFrequency`: The frequency at which coupon payments are made.

`issuer`: The address of the bond issuer.

`whitelist`: A mapping of addresses to check if they are whitelisted investors.

`kycApproved`: A mapping of addresses to check if they have passed KYC.

`highRiskCustomers`: A mapping of addresses to check if they are high-risk customers.

`couponPayments`: A mapping of addresses to track the coupon payments made to investors.


# Constructor
The constructor initializes the bond with default values. You can set the initial values according to your requirements.

# addToWhitelist Function
The addToWhitelist function adds an investor to the whitelist. Only the bond issuer can add investors to the whitelist.

# removeFromWhitelist Function
The removeFromWhitelist function removes an investor from the whitelist. Only the bond issuer can remove investors from the whitelist.

# approveKYC Function
The approveKYC function approves the KYC (Know Your Customer) for an investor. Only the bond issuer can approve KYC.

# rejectKYC Function
The rejectKYC function rejects the KYC for an investor. Only the bond issuer can reject KYC.

# addHighRiskCustomer Function
The addHighRiskCustomer function adds a customer to the list of high-risk customers. Only the bond issuer can add high-risk customers.

# removeHighRiskCustomer Function
The removeHighRiskCustomer function removes a customer from the list of high-risk customers. Only the bond issuer can remove high-risk customers.

# payCoupon Function
The payCoupon function allows whitelisted investors to receive coupon payments. It checks if the bond has matured and if it's a coupon payment date. If the conditions are met, it calculates the coupon amount based on the principal and coupon rate, and updates the coupon payment for the investor.

# repayPrincipal Function
The repayPrincipal function allows whitelisted investors to receive the principal amount at the bond maturity. It checks if the bond has matured and transfers the principal amount to the investor.

# settleBond Function
The settleBond function allows whitelisted investors to settle the bond. It checks if the bond has matured, calculates the coupon payment and principal amount for the investor, and transfers the total amount to the investor. It also resets the coupon payment for the investor.


Constructor
The constructor initializes the bond with default values. You can set the initial values according to your requirements.

solidity
Copy code
constructor() {
    bond.principal = 100000; // Principal amount in a defined currency
    bond.couponRate = 5; // 5% coupon rate
    bond.maturity = block.timestamp + 365 days; // Maturity in 1 year
    bond.couponFrequency = 30 days; // Coupon payment every 30 days
    bond.issuer = msg.sender; // Issuer's address
}
addToWhitelist Function
The addToWhitelist function adds an investor to the whitelist. Only the bond issuer can add investors to the whitelist.

solidity
Copy code
function addToWhitelist(address investor) external {
    require(msg.sender == bond.issuer, "Only the issuer can add investors to the whitelist.");
    bond.whitelist[investor] = true;
}
removeFromWhitelist Function
The removeFromWhitelist function removes an investor from the whitelist. Only the bond issuer can remove investors from the whitelist.

solidity
Copy code
function removeFromWhitelist(address investor) external {
    require(msg.sender == bond.issuer, "Only the issuer can remove investors from the whitelist.");
    bond.whitelist[investor] = false;
}
approveKYC Function
The approveKYC function approves the KYC (Know Your Customer) for an investor. Only the bond issuer can approve KYC.

solidity
Copy code
function approveKYC(address investor) external {
    require(msg.sender == bond.issuer, "Only the issuer can approve KYC.");
    bond.kycApproved[investor] = true;
}
rejectKYC Function
The rejectKYC function rejects the KYC for an investor. Only the bond issuer can reject KYC.

solidity
Copy code
function rejectKYC(address investor) external {
    require(msg.sender == bond.issuer, "Only the issuer can reject KYC.");
    bond.kycApproved[investor] = false;
}
addHighRiskCustomer Function
The addHighRiskCustomer function adds a customer to the list of high-risk customers. Only the bond issuer can add high-risk customers.

solidity
Copy code
function addHighRiskCustomer(address customer) external {
    require(msg.sender == bond.issuer, "Only the issuer can add high-risk customers.");
    bond.highRiskCustomers[customer] = true;
}
removeHighRiskCustomer Function
The removeHighRiskCustomer function removes a customer from the list of high-risk customers. Only the bond issuer can remove high-risk customers.

solidity
Copy code
function removeHighRiskCustomer(address customer) external {
    require(msg.sender == bond.issuer, "Only the issuer can remove high-risk customers.");
    bond.highRiskCustomers[customer] = false;
}
payCoupon Function
The payCoupon function allows whitelisted investors to receive coupon payments. It checks if the bond has matured and if it's a coupon payment date. If the conditions are met, it calculates the coupon amount based on the principal and coupon rate, and updates the coupon payment for the investor.

solidity
Copy code
function payCoupon() external onlyWhitelisted {
    require(block.timestamp < bond.maturity, "Bond has already matured.");
    require(block.timestamp % bond.couponFrequency == 0, "Not a coupon payment date.");

    // Perform coupon payment logic here
    uint256 couponAmount = (bond.principal * bond.couponRate) / 100;
    require(couponAmount > 0, "Coupon amount is zero.");

    // Update coupon payment for the investor
    bond.couponPayments[msg.sender] += couponAmount;
}
repayPrincipal Function
The repayPrincipal function allows whitelisted investors to receive the principal amount at the bond maturity. It checks if the bond has matured and transfers the principal amount to the investor.

solidity
Copy code
function repayPrincipal() external onlyWhitelisted {
    require(block.timestamp >= bond.maturity, "Bond has not yet matured.");

    // Perform principal repayment logic here
    uint256 principalAmount = bond.principal;
    require(principalAmount > 0, "Principal amount is zero.");

    // Transfer the principal amount to the investor
    address payable investor = payable(msg.sender);
    require(address(this).balance >= principalAmount, "Insufficient balance in the contract.");
    investor.transfer(principalAmount);
}
settleBond Function
The settleBond function allows whitelisted investors to settle the bond. It checks if the bond has matured, calculates the coupon payment and principal amount for the investor, and transfers the total amount to the investor. It also resets the coupon payment for the investor.

solidity
Copy code
function settleBond() external onlyWhitelisted {
    require(block.timestamp >= bond.maturity, "Bond has not yet matured.");

    // Perform settlement logic here
    address payable investor = payable(msg.sender);
    uint256 couponPayment = bond.couponPayments[msg.sender];
    uint256 principalAmount = bond.principal;

    require(couponPayment + principalAmount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance in the contract.");

    // Transfer the coupon payment and principal amount to the investor
    investor.transfer(couponPayment + principalAmount);

    // Reset coupon payment for the investor
    bond.couponPayments[msg.sender] = 0;
}
Please note that this is a basic implementation of the bond tokenization smart contract, and you may need to add additional functionality and security measures based on your specific requirements and best practices.
